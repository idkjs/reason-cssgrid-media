# REASON, CSS-GRID, Image Rendering, Audio Demo

## Reason Experiment

The audio player in player.re is just a mock up. [bs-webap](https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-webapi-incubator) doesnt support audio controls yet so I need to figure out a way around or see about contributing to the bs-webapi project.


## TODO

- add working player
- add real data, music
